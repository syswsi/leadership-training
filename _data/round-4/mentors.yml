Catalyze innovation,
Push for accessible Neurotech,
Empower people through education in entrepreneurship and technology.


About three years ago I cofounded one of the larger incubators in Quebec called District 3 which provides free support for startups. I fell in love with the maker ideology in 2013 during a visit to my first maker fair in New York which shifted my energy towards pushing for accessible neurotechnology.

Currently, I'm a co-founder of NeurotechX, a non-profit organization which is facilitating the advancement of Neurotechnology by offering networking opportunities and learning resources and open source tools. "
